{ "id": 7, "title": "Hot red curry is sexy!", "body": "Whether to order red or green Thai curry at a restaurant, is a topic of some confusion. Which one should you order? Do you know the difference between the two variants of the popular Asian curry? Here’s how you can decide which one is more appropriate for you taste. Red Thai curry is made of 20 red chillies that give it a beautiful red colour. It is cooked with dried red chilli that is soaked to remove the harshness and the heat from it. Soaking the chillies also lends an excellent flavor to the dish. Thai red curry is very soupy as the chilli paste is mixed with coconut milk or water. The curry varies from region to region. In Thailand, the red chillies can be hotter than they are in India or vice versa, depending on where the chillies were grown. Hence, the taste of the curry prepared in the subcontinent is a little different from what it tastes in Thailand. However, the ingredients remain the same.", "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1455619452474-d2be8b1e70cd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjF9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80", "author": "Foody Guy" }, 
{ "id": 8, "title": "Ice cream is forever", "body": "Ice cream is a multiphase system composed of an unfrozen serum phase, air bubbles, ice crystals, and fat globes (1). During the whipping and freezing process, some of the fat globules in the mix stick together during collisions caused by the rotating scraper blades, forming clumps and clusters of fat globules. This process is known as partial coalescence (2). Partially coalesced fat globule clusters are responsible for surrounding and stabilising air cells and for creating a semi-continuous network or matrix of fat throughout the ice cream. This structure has a significant influence on dryness when the ice cream is extracted from the ice cream machine (aids in novelty molding), smooth and creamy mouthfeel, resistance to shrinking during storage, and resistance to meltdown or good shape retention (necessary for soft-serve operations)", "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579954115563-e72bf1381629?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80", "author": "Dessert Lover" },

They can also develop through smoking, air pollution, stress, and other environmental pressures. If too many free radicals stay in the body, oxidative stress can occur. This can result in cell damage and may lead to a range of diseases, such as cancer and heart disease.
